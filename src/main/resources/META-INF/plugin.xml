  <description><![CDATA[

    <p>A popup menu for IDEA to provide easier access to run
    configurations.</p>

    <p>The popup menu shows a list of run configurations in two sections:
    Favorites (first) and others. Each section can be separately configured to
    show the configurations last used first or using the ordering of the run
    configurations settings dialog.</p>

    <p>For each entry, the popup remembers the last executor used (Run, Debug,
    etc.)</p>

    <p>The popup menu is searchable and also handles searching for the first
    letters of words (e.g. search for «riwp» to find «Run IDEA with
    plugin»).</p>

    <p>It can be both placed into the toolbar or bound to a key. It can
    replace the default run dropdown.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/Abnaxos/idea-run-popup>Project’s
    GitHub page</a> for more information.</p>

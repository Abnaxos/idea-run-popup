    <p>A popup menu for IDEA to provide easier access to run
    configurations.</p>

    <!--suppress HtmlUnknownTarget -->
    <img src="@@repoContentRootUrl@@/images/run-popup.png" alt="Run Popup">

    <p>The popup menu shows a list of run configurations in two sections:
    Favorites (first) and others. Each section can be separately configured to
    show the configurations last used first or using the ordering of the run
    configurations settings dialog.</p>

    <p>For each entry, the popup remembers the last executor used (Run, Debug,
    etc.)</p>

    <p>The popup menu is searchable and also handles searching for the first
    letters of words (e.g. search for "riwp" to find "Run IDEA with
    plugin").</p>

    <p>It can be both placed into the toolbar or bound to a key. It can
    replace the default run dropdown.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/Abnaxos/idea-run-popup">Projectâ€™s
    GitHub page</a> for more information.</p>

    <h3>Configuration Tips</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>Remove <i>"Select Run/Debug Configuration"</i> action and
        <i>"Run/Debug"</i> group from your toolbar, then add <i>"Run Popup"</i>
        and <i>"Stop"</i> instead. The <i>"Stop"</i> action will show a
        drop-down to choose which process to stop when more than one is
        running (if only one process is running, it will just stop that one).
      </li>

      <li>By default, the run popup is bound to <i>Alt-X</i>. You may also
        want to bind <i>"Stop"</i> to <i>Alt-Shift-X</i> to get a stop
        popup.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>1.3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "helpers" category. Configurations marked as helper will
          <em>never</em> be shown on the top. This is useful e.g. for
          run configurations that aren't normally run manually.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Always display the last used run configuration on the top (turn
          off in options).</li>
      <li>Move run popup settings to submenu, add action to edit run
          configurations.</li>
      <li>Move run popup settings and state to workspace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.1.1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Set timestamp both on choosing from popup <em>and</em> running the
          configuration in some other way. The second one may not work when
          delegating build/run actions to an external build system, but for
          all other run configurations, it'll work as expected.</li>
      <li>Compatibility with 2020.3.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.1.0</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Set timestamp on choosing from popup instead of running the configuration.
          This way, tracking also works when delegating build/run actions to an
          external build system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.0.1</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Compatibility fix for IDEA 2018.3</li>
    </ul>

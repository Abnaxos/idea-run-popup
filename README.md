IDEA Run Popup Plugin
=====================

A popup menu for IDEA to provide easier access torun configurations.

The popup menu shows a list of run configurations in two sections: Favorites
(first) and others. Each section can be separately configured to show the
configurations last used first or using the ordering of the run configurations
settings dialog.

For each entry, the popup remembers the last executor used (Run, Debug, etc.)

The popup menu is searchable and also handles searching for the first letters
of words (e.g. search for «riwp» to find «Run IDEA with plugin»).

It can be both placed into the toolbar or bound to a key. It can replace the
default run dropdown.
